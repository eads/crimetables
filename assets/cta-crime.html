        <p>You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>
        <p>I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Ye-ha! I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--</p>
        <p>In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. He is here. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.</p>
        <p>You mean it controls your actions? I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. He is here. Red Five standing by. I find your lack of faith disturbing.</p>
        <p>Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? What!?</p>
